chefscripts
===========

Various scripts I use to manage my Chef servers and clients

The backup and restore scripts are my feeble attempt at modification. The backup is based on jtimberman's script and I added exporting of client public keys but in practice it didn't work on restore. He references https://github.com/stevendanna/knife-hacks/ as a better rewrite of his scripts. My restore script came from somewhere on the interwebs but I lost the source. If you know the original author I will gladly attribute. Again, stevendanna has a better script than mine. but doesn't include clients.
